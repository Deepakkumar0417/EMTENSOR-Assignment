Problem Statement:

Title: Development of an Open-Source AI Framework for Automated Brain Segmentation, Abnormality
Detection, and Statistical Analysis in Neuroimaging

Objective:
Design, train, and validate an open-source AI model to accurately segment anatomical regions of the brain
(e.g., gray matter, white matter, ventricles, hippocampus) and identify abnormalities (e.g., tumors, lesions,
atrophy) in 3D neuroimaging data (e.g., MRI, CT). The framework must incorporate statistical analysis to
quantify uncertainty, validate model performance, and correlate findings with clinical outcomes for improved
diagnostic decision-making.

Datasets:
Open Source Brain/EBRAINS/PhysioNet

Scope of Work:
Data Pipeline:

Curate/preprocess open-source neuroimaging datasets.
Implement augmentation (e.g., affine transforms, intensity shifts) to improve robustness.

Model Development:

Adapt or train an open-source architecture (e.g., nnUNet, MONAI, DeepMedic) for multi-class brain
segmentation.
Integrate anomaly detection modules (e.g., U-Net with attention gates, transformers) to flag abnormalities.

Inference &amp; Deployment:

Optimize the model for inference.

Statistical Analysis:

Perform hypothesis testing (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) to compare segmented regions across patient cohorts.
Generate visual reports (e.g., heatmaps, volumetric plots) to highlight abnormalities.
